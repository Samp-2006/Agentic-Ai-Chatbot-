Agentic AI Chatbot

The Agentic AI Chatbot is a smart assistant that goes beyond basic question-answering. It is designed to **think like an agent**, plan its actions, use tools (like calculators or web search), and respond more intelligently — just like a human assistant would.


What This Project Does

- Takes user input and understands the context
- Uses tools to fetch answers (calculator, search engine, etc.)
- Responds with clear, helpful, and smart replies
- Can handle multi-step tasks like:
  - Solving math problems
  - Summarizing text
  - Answering follow-up questions


 Goal of the Project

The goal is to build a chatbot that’s not just reactive but **proactive** — one that can reason, use external tools, and **act as an intelligent agent** to help users complete tasks or get answers.


 Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenAI API (or any LLM)
- Streamlit (for web interface)
- Basic Python tools (e.g., requests, math)


  How to Use

1. Run the chatbot using:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
